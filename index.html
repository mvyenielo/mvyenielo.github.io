    <img src="IMG_8531.jpeg">

    <p> Hi! I wear many hats.
    </p>

    <p id="blurb">I am an educator and results-minded individual, expanding my experience
      into software engineering. My computer programming endeavors are
      self-driven, and I am excited to hone and build new skills. I strive to be
      part of a creative, purpose-driven, collaborative, and analytical
      environment. During my time in education, I have adapted, as well as
      created resources from the ground up to best fit the needs of my students
      and peers. I have strong project management skills, and am focused on the
      impact and success of anything I am involved in. I enjoy problem solving,
      analyzing data, and finding creative solutions when challenges arise. I am
      a forever learner, and am not afraid to reflect on my own work in order
      to improve my practice.
      <br>
      <br>
      Beyond programming, I enjoy spending time outdoors, muay thai, photography, learning to sew,
      cooking, following track and field, and dabbling in music.
